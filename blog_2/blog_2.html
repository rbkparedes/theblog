      <p>It is actually insane how many food stands there are in Camden Market, but most of them kind of sell the same thing which is the English version of Chinese food. It can be pretty overwhelming as they are shouting at you to try to get you to try their food in hopes that you will buy some. In a quiet, slightly hidden alley is where I found this interesting looking Korean hot dog place. I had been wanting to try a Korean hot dog for a while, so this was the perfect time to do so. If you don't know what a Korean hot dog is, it's more like a corndog but you can choose to have cheese instead of a sausage or you can do half cheese half sausage and the breading can be pieces of potatoes or hot cheetos covering or you can do the classic which is what I did. I really recommend this place if you want something quick and easy to eat while you browse around the market.</p>
