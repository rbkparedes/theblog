  <p>It is actually insane how many food stands there are in Camden Market, but most of them kind of sell the same thing which is the English version of Chinesee food. It can be pretty overwhelming as they are shouting at you to try to get you to try their food in hopes that you will buy some. I don't know about you, but shouting at me to try to get me to buy your food will actually do the complete opposite, so I ran away from those stands which were the main food spots to find something else. In a quiet, slightly hidden alley is where a found this interesting looking korean hot dog place. The main reason why I ended up buying from this place was because my friend got an acai bowl from the plave next door, had it not been for that I don't think I would've gotten one, but I am so glad I did. I had been wanting to try a korean hot dog for a while, so this was the perfect time to do so. If you don't know what a Korean hot dog is, it's more like a corndog but you can choose to have cheese instead of a sausage or you can do half  cheese half suasage and the breading can pieces of potatoes or hot cheetos covering or you can do the classic which is what I did. I really reccomend this place if you want something quick and easy to eat while you browse around the market.</p>
