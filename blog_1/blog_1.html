    <h2>About the Store</h2>
    <p>If you are like me and love a good book shop and have a book-buying problem, you will love Walden Books. It is an independent bookshop named ater the book "Walden " written by Henry David Thoreau and established in 1979. They had a good collection of vintage books with some dating back to the 1920s, those were obviously a bit more pricey but nothing too crazy. All books are used, so you will not find any new books from the past year or two but you will find awesome hidden gems.  </p>
