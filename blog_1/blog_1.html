    <h2>About the Store</h2>
    <p>If you are like me and love a good book shop and have a book-buying problem, you will love Walden Books. It is an independent bookshop named ater the book "Walden " written by Henry David Thoreau and established in 1979. They had a good collection of vintage books with some dating back to the 1920s, those were obviously a bit more pricey but nothing too crazy. All books are used, so you will not find any new books from the past year or two but you will find awesome hidden gems. There are so many books, so you will definitely have to browse for a while but it is so worth it because you can find some really good stuff.  </p>

    <p><strong> Mary and Maria by Mary Wollstonecraft and Matilda by Mary Shelley</strong> <br>
        These three works of fiction - two by Mary Wollstonecraft, the radical author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, and one by her daughter Mary Shelley, creator of Frankenstein - are powerfully emotive stories that combine passion with forceful feminist argument. In Mary Wollstonecraft's Mary, the heroine flees her young husband in order to nurse her dearest friend, Ann, and finds genuine love, while Maria tells of a desperate young woman who seeks consolation in the arms of another man after the loss of her child. And Mary Shelley's Matilda - suppressed for over a century - tells the story of a woman alienated from society by the incestuous passion of her father. Humane, compassionate and highly controversial, these stories demonstrate the strongly original genius of their authors.
