<p>If you are like me and love a good book shop and have a book-buying problem, you will love Walden Books. It is an independent bookshop named ater the book "Walden " written by Henry David Thoreau and established in 1979. They had a good collection of vintage books with some dating back to the 1920s, those were obviously a bit more pricey but nothing too crazy. All books are used, so you will not find any new books from the past year or two but you will find awesome hidden gems. You might also find vintage covers of populars books which is my favorite thing to search for/find. There are so many books, so you will defienlty have to browse for a while but it is so worth it because you can find some really good stuff. I ended up buying a vintage copy of Romola by George Elliot and this book that included a novel by Mary Wollstonecraft and her daughter Mary Shelley, which I am really excited to read. The store gets quite a few of customers, a lot of them are people that walk there from Camden Market, like me, a few are just people passing by, or people that live nearby. So I would reccomend on going on a weekday to save your self the trouble of having to be there when there a lot of people, not in the bookshop but also just Camden in general.
