   <h2> About the Blog</h2>
   <p> Hi! My name is Rebecca and I wrote this blog to help you discover the best Camden Market has to offer without the overwhelming journey. I recently traveled to London and Camden Market was one of my favorite places with so much to offer. I have chosen three of my favorite stores in Camden that I think are a must-see. The stores I have chosen are a book shop, a food stand, and a jacket shop.
    Whether you are visiting Camden Market soon or you are simply curious, this blog is for you. I hope you like it!</p>
